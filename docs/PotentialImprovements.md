   - **Input Handling:** Capturing and processing user inputs (keyboard events).
   - **Output Rendering:** Displaying data from the PTY process to the user interface.

2. **Session Management:**
   - **Multiple Sessions:** Supporting multiple concurrent sessions, each with its own input and output streams.
   - **Session Isolation:** Ensuring that data and commands are isolated per session to prevent cross-interference.

3. **Process Control:**
   - **Process Spawning:** Initiating and managing shell or application processes within the PTY.
   - **Signal Handling:** Sending and receiving signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM) to control the PTY process.

4. **Window Resizing:**
